A visual web-based simulation tool that demonstrates CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SJF, Round Robin) with animated context switching. This educational application generates random processes, simulates their execution with configurable parameters, and displays real-time performance metrics through interactive Gantt charts. Built with vanilla JavaScript and CSS animations, it helps users understand operating system concepts like turnaround time, waiting time, and CPU utilization through engaging visualizations.
